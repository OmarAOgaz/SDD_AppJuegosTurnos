# Verification Report

**Change**: mvp-lobby-turn-timer  
**Version**: delta specs (`lobby`, `turn-timer`, `lan-transport` delta)  
**Mode**: Standard (`strict_tdd: false`)  
**Date**: 2026-07-08  
**Persistence**: hybrid (`openspec/` + Engram `ssd_app_juegos_turnos`)

### Completeness

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Tasks total | 28 |
| Tasks complete | 26 |
| Tasks incomplete | 2 (4.3, 4.4 manual E2E) |

Task notes:
- **4.1**: Partial — `ended_screen_smoke_test` exists; profile-save and lobby-picker widget smokes listed in task text are not present as dedicated widget tests (covered indirectly by unit/repo tests).
- **4.3–4.4**: Unchecked — no manual 2-device E2E sign-off recorded for this change.

| Leave before start | Client leaves voluntarily | `LobbyRules.tryLeave` in source; `sendLeave` on client dispose | ⚠️ PARTIAL |

#### turn-timer (8 requirements / 12 scenarios)

| Requirement | Scenario | Test / Evidence | Result |
|-------------|----------|-----------------|--------|
| START_GAME freezes config | Start opens full-duration turn 1 | `turn_engine_test` startGame | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| PASS_TURN validation | Active player passes | `turn_engine_test` | ✅ COMPLIANT |

| Variable BETWEEN_ROUNDS | Variable mode pauses between rounds | `turn_engine_test` | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| Variable BETWEEN_ROUNDS | Host reorders then starts next round | `TurnEngine.tryReorderTurnOrder` + `startNextRound` in source; **no reorder UI in GameScreen** | ⚠️ PARTIAL |
| WARNING / EXCEEDED | Warning at ≤15 s | `turn_engine_test` + `client_sync_state_test` | ✅ COMPLIANT |
| WARNING / EXCEEDED | Exceeded accumulates on pass | `turn_engine_test` | ✅ COMPLIANT |

#### lan-transport (delta)

| Requirement | Scenario | Test / Evidence | Result |
|-------------|----------|-----------------|--------|
| GameRoom messaging | Lobby JOIN accepted on transport | `host_room_controller` JOIN handler; no socket integration test | ⚠️ PARTIAL |
| GameRoom messaging | Expanded GAME_STATE envelope | `game_room.toGameStatePayload`; `ws_envelope_test` | ⚠️ PARTIAL |
| Minimal room stub (modified) | Multi-client game room | Domain + controller source; manual E2E pending | ⚠️ PARTIAL |
| Minimal room stub (modified) | Spike-only limitation removed | `GameRoom` in host; spike demoted `kDebugMode` | ✅ COMPLIANT |

### Design Coherence

| Decision | Expected | Observed | Result |
|----------|----------|----------|--------|
| `GameRoom` replaces stub | Host uses `GameRoom` | `HostRoomController` uses `GameRoom`; `spike_room_stub.dart` retained unused | ✅ |
| Pure `LobbyRules` + `TurnEngine` | Extracted from controller | `lib/core/domain/lobby_rules.dart`, `turn_engine.dart` | ✅ |
| Chained PRs profile→lobby→timer | 3 PRs to `main` | PR1–PR3 merged (`f0fd53a`, `5102dab`, `7214087`) | ✅ |
| Picker exclusivity UI-only | No `UPDATE_PLAYER_REJECTED` | Silent ignore in `LobbyRules`; eligible picker in UI | ✅ |
| Lobby reorder UI | Host reorder in lobby | API on controller only; **no drag/reorder in `LobbyScreen`** | ⚠️ |
| Spike demoted | Not primary path | Home → Lobby; `/spike` gated `kDebugMode` | ✅ |
| Ended minimal screen | Not toast-only | `EndedScreen` + `/ended` route | ✅ |

### Issues

#### CRITICAL

| ID | Issue | Recommendation |
|----|-------|----------------|
| C1 | Tasks **4.3** and **4.4** unchecked — no manual 2-device E2E sign-off | Run E2E on SM A505G + SM X210 (or equivalent); check tasks when PASS |

#### WARNING

| ID | Issue | Recommendation |
|----|-------|----------------|
| W1 | Task 4.1 claims profile + lobby picker widget smokes; only `ended_screen_smoke_test` exists | Add widget smokes or narrow task wording at archive |
| W2 | Host lobby **reorder** and BETWEEN_ROUNDS **reorder** UI not implemented (backend only) | Add UI or defer to follow-up; document in archive |
| W3 | Many transport/integration scenarios rely on source inspection only | Cover with manual E2E (4.3–4.4) or integration tests |
| W4 | `START_NEXT_ROUND` / `REORDER_TURN_ORDER` not exposed via client WS (host-local only) | Acceptable for MVP host-on-device; document |

#### SUGGESTION

| ID | Issue | Recommendation |
|----|-------|----------------|
| S1 | Remove or archive unused `spike_room_stub.dart` | Cleanup in archive PR |
| S2 | Add integration test for JOIN → LOBBY_STATE → START_GAME over loopback WS | Post-MVP hardening |

### Final Verdict

**PASS WITH WARNINGS**

Automated gate is green (analyze + 35 tests). Core domain behavior for lobby assignment, config clamps, turn engine (pass, rounds, phases, excess), client timer interpolation, and ended screen is covered by unit/widget tests. **Archive-ready for code quality**; **manual E2E (4.3–4.4) and several integration/UI scenarios remain open** before treating all spec scenarios as runtime-proven.

**Next recommended phase**: `/sdd-archive` (may proceed with warnings documented, matching LAN MVP precedent) **after** user accepts E2E gap or completes 4.3–4.4.
